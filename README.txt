Intro:

The Voxelite Mod Project was developed by RPG Jones (@Baxterdam_D105), Trico Everfire and Phillippe.
The story for the mod, it's structures and characters are a result of
creative thinking, RPG Jones (@Baxterdam_D105) came up with the idea of Voxelite
a toxic, corrupting fluid accidentally discovered by the ancient Voxivan civilization.
the original goal of the Voxivans was to make a pure element that could be used to repair the world, 
however, something went horribly wrong.
outside of the Voxelite Dimension the blocks, fluids and items become unstable
after a praticularly bad accident voxelized biomes started appearing, a terraformed
biome, devoid of most of it's colors, lakes filled with agressive Voxelite Liquid
which will erode ALMOST any item into voxelized sludge, the only items known to resist
the erosion are Avokinate, a mineral found at the bottom of Voxelite lakes, and Iron, but iron is not
as resistant as Avokinate.
